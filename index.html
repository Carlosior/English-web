    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Carlos Orozco, an English teacher with over two years of experience teaching in the vibrant region of Eastern Antioquia. My passion for language and communication has driven me to support students from diverse backgrounds in achieving their English learning goals.<br><br>

    In addition to my teaching career, I bring valuable experience from the world of customer service, having worked with leading companies in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. This background has enriched my teaching with real-world communication skills and cultural insights that I pass on to my students.<br><br>

    I've also collaborated with local companies, helping train and empower their staff through tailored English programs that enhance workplace performance and professional growth.<br><br>

    My mission is to make learning English practical, engaging, and impactful — whether you're aiming to improve your fluency, succeed in international exams, or grow professionally.</p>
